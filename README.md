# Machine Learning Style Transfer
### Jared Paubel

Final project for Advanced Python with Machine Learning

In this project I will learn how to use Fast API to develop a web application for serving a style transfers. A style transfer is a type of image classification where the convolutional neural network analyzes a submitted photo and recreates it with a base image it was previously trained on. Often time the base image is of famous artworks, but could be of any image.
